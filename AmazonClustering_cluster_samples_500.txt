340648  B007I7YZJK       77                        More fruit than Tea

311007  Great Taste-but buy it at the supermarket instead   
311133            Great taste, but it isn't very 'minty'.   
311067                                         Refreshing   
311050                        The colors, man, the colors   
311119                refreshing, not too heavy drink mix   
311063     Tasty Option To A Cocktail - Or Add The Booze!   
311110      Easy to use but not as good as the real thing   
311046                                  Flavor not for us

330977                                    Very Tasty, But   
330937                                           Amazing.   
330943  Delightfully Delicious for the Inner-Gamer in You   
330948         It doesn't matter how much they advertise,   
330899                           Doesn't Sate my Kravings   
330939       Decent, sweet, doesn't stay crispy in milk..   
330897         Not for the "occasional" chocolate fancier   
330935                                  Best cereal ever.   
330892                                            Skip it   
330940                                      a tasty treat   
330984                                        Good stuff!   
330910                                  sweet and crunchy   
330938            Better as a snack than everyday cereal?   
330893                       It's OK.... Just not "great"
